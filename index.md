## AI Philosophy

### Transformative Impact

I see AI as one of the most powerful forces shaping our future. I'm passionate about contributing to its responsible and meaningful evolution, ensuring that the technology uplifts society.

### Continuous Learning

The pace of innovation is relentlessâ€”and I thrive in it. I stay curious, actively expand my knowledge, and prioritize keeping up with breakthroughs so Iâ€™m always ready to engage and contribute.

### Adaptability First

In AI, rigid plans can't keep up with reality. I embrace flexibility, iteration, and evolution as core to innovation. For me, the willingness to pivot and experiment is key to driving progress.

### Practical Solutions

I care deeply about building AI systems that are safe, intuitive, and useful. If the job calls for a toaster, I wonâ€™t fire up an industrial ovenâ€”I prioritize thoughtful solutions that meet real human needs.

## The Moment I Found AI

I was set on med school â€” drawn to the idea of helping people and understanding how the body works. I worked hard, got the gradesâ€¦ but life had other ideas.

Engineering wasnâ€™t where I thought Iâ€™d end up, but it opened a door I hadnâ€™t expected. Thatâ€™s where I discovered control systems â€” guiding real-world behavior through feedback and adjustment. The logic behind them felt elegant and purposeful. I loved how math could not only explain something â€” but help shape and refine it.

Then came AI, especially neural networks, and everything shifted. It was like modeling the brain through data. What fascinated me most was how AI could uncover patterns in massive datasets and use them to guide smarter decisions.

The blend of math, optimization, pattern recognition â€” and that feeling of intellectual harmony â€” made it all click. It still does.
